          &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As an inventor and innovator, it is now possible to prototype, evaluate and bring creations to market by way of digital
          fabrication tools. The Digital Maker and Fabrication (DMF) degree prepares graduates to design and build new technology
          devices by combining design theory, programming, materials, human factors and prototyping with 3D print and other maker
          technologies. Students in this program will model and design objects using 3D software. Students will also learn to inform
          their designs based upon choosing the best materials for each design element. Students will learn how to program the
          hardware and electronics driving their devices, using tools such as C++ and Arduino in ways that support creating smart
          devices and internet enabled devices. By learning how to effectively use maker prototyping technologies such as 3D printers,
          digital cutters, CNC fabric devices and virtual reality tools, students are able to rapidly visualize and prototype devices. DMF
          students become adept at the process of refining technology creations and devices to make them ready for market and within
          design and fabrication settings.

      <h1 class="text">Digital Making & Fabrication Objectives</h1>
        <p class="ptext" style="width:75%; text-align: left;">
          1. Demonstrate the ability to prototype, build and apply for patents for technology products meeting specific human factors,
          form and function criteria. <br /><br />
          2. Demonstrate the ability to evaluate trends in design principles and apply them into the form and function of devices. <br /><br />
          3. Demonstrate the ability to evaluate material and build technique options during the creation of products and their
          prototypes. <br /><br />
          4. Demonstrate the ability to evaluate and implement developments within electromechanical, algorithmic, robotic,
          microprocessor, sensor and other advancing technology areas while making product design decisions. <br /><br />
          5. Demonstrate the ability to work within a maker studio environment to design, build, test and revise products that meet
          client timeline, design and quality requirements. <br /><br />
          6. Demonstrate proficiency with industry accepted prototyping, modeling, build and maker tools and techniques.
